    fatal   cannot function at all

  op_endpoint in auth responses (rev 171)
  nonce restrictions (rev 179)

  (Do not) Allow extensions in openid 1 messages?

  Simple registration extension

  - Error responses:
    - currently we throw exceptions when errors are encountered;
    - must be examined and, where appropriate, convert them to error
      response messages as required by the specs.

  - Compatibility mode:
    - out-of-band RP nonce method
        - RP needs to self-sign nonces
    - check limits defined in v1

  - How to determine which of GET/POST the endpoint supports?
    - direct messages:
            POST only, both v1 and v2
    - indirect messages:
            HTTP redirect (GET): v1, v2 compatibility
            FORM redirect: v2 only, POST not enforced
