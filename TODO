.... OpenID4Java Library - TODO

========================================================================

=> Documentation and Packaging

 - Complete JavaDocs
 - Do we package 256 bit libs?

=> Tests

=> Samples

  - Sample code
  - Documentation

=> Implementation

  - Update based on finialized versions of the following:
    - OpenID Authentication 2.0
    - OpenID Attribute Exchange 1.0

  - Extensions to implement:
    - OpenID Signed Assertions 1.0
    - OpenID Authentication Age 1.0
    - OpenID Relying Party Identity 1.0
    - Simple Registration

  - Logging: Log4j
    debug   everything else
    ->info  general protocol flow
    warn    recoverable exceptions
    error   transaction failures
    fatal   cannot function at all

  - Normalization : review XRI parsing to mach the latest spec / XRI syntax 2.1
    (when when syntax 2.1 goes out)

  - MessageExtension.providesIdentifier()
    - review interface to allow exchange of messages with identifiers at all
    - review affected message validation logic

  - Compatibility mode - check/enforce limits defined in v1

  - Allow extensions in openid 1 messages?

  --> Nice to have, but not essential:

    - Add a 'stop-using-timeout' to associations on the RP side, when they are 
      about to expire (e.g. 5 min before expiration): improves user-experience 
      (associations will not expire in the middle of a transaction).

    - Don't normalize the url before redirects (not needed, extra cost)

    - Auth* class hierarchy reorganization

    - Factory method for incoming messages
    - Review consumer verification flow

    - Make isValid() throw exceptions

    - rename IdP to OP (cosmetic)

    - Interface for saving discovered information
        - into session, db, url/return_to, etc.
            - saveDiscoveryInfo(... , session, return_to)
            - loadDiscoveryInfo(httpRequest)
